<p>Buttafly is a <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html">Rails engine</a> which, once bolted onto your <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> application, lets you import real data from spreadsheets into your <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">postgres</a> database, complete with the correct associations to parent records. </p>

<h2>
<a id="example" class="anchor" href="#example" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Example</h2>

<p>Let us say that your app tracks information on wineries and that: </p>

<ol>
<li>Each <strong>winery</strong> <em>has many</em> <strong>wines</strong> that have been produced under its imprimatur, in a number of different years or "vintages."</li>
<li>Each <strong>wine</strong> axiomatically <em>belongs to</em> a <strong>winery</strong>, and also <em>has many</em> <strong>reviews</strong> written about it.</li>
<li>Each wine <strong>review</strong> <em>belongs to</em> both the <strong>wine</strong> of which it is a subject, and to the <strong>reviewer</strong> who reviewed it. </li>
</ol>

<p>Your model associatons might look something like this:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="pl-c"># in app/models/winery.rb</span>

has_many <span class="pl-c1">:wines</span></pre></div>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="pl-c"># in app/models/wine.rb</span>

has_many <span class="pl-c1">:reviews</span>
belongs_to <span class="pl-c1">:winery</span>

validates <span class="pl-c1">:winery</span>, <span class="pl-c1">presence:</span> <span class="pl-c1">true</span></pre></div>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="pl-c"># in app/models/review.rb</span>

belongs_to <span class="pl-c1">:wine</span>
belongs_to <span class="pl-c1">:reviewer</span>, <span class="pl-c1">class_name:</span> <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>User<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>

validates <span class="pl-c1">:reviewer</span>, <span class="pl-c1">:wine</span>, <span class="pl-c1">presence:</span> <span class="pl-c1">true</span></pre></div>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="pl-c"># in app/models/user.rb</span>

has_many <span class="pl-c1">:reviews</span>, <span class="pl-c1">foreign_key:</span> <span class="pl-c1">:reviewer_id</span></pre></div>

<p>Let us also say that you have entered into an arrangement with an infamous wine critic, in which she has agreed to let you publish some of her reviews. She isn't willing to recreate the reviews in your app by hand, but she has condescended to provide you a spreadsheet, the first few rows of which might look something like these:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Winery name</th>
<th>Wine name</th>
<th align="right">Vintage</th>
<th>Rating</th>
<th>Review</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Ernie &amp; Julio Gallows</td>
<td>chenin blanc</td>
<td align="right">2009</td>
<td>82</td>
<td>Egocentric yet oxymoronically fleshy Chenin Blanc. Shows bug spray, middle-aged raisin, scant pepper. Drink now through never.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Charles Shah</td>
<td>pinot noir</td>
<td align="right">2008</td>
<td>83</td>
<td>Nearly matured and corpulent Pinot Noir. Essenses of mint, sad dog-breath, perceptable fois gras. Drink now through 2015.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Duckhorndog</td>
<td>semillon</td>
<td align="right">2003</td>
<td>99</td>
<td>Overdressed nevertheless complex and stunning Semillon. Shows kalamata olive, hedonistic nectarine, bashful tomato. Drink now through Friday.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Great! Now to get those reviews into your database with the correct associations! If there aren't too many reviews, you can hand them off to an intern and ask her to navigate your applicaton to create the reviews, wineries, and wineries all by hand and with the correct associations. Alternatively you might commission a developer to write a script that could do the same thing. But what if this spreadsheet is only the first of many, from a diverse group of infamous wine critics, each of which has slightly different headers and columns? </p>

<p>This is where Buttafly is designed to help out.</p>

<p>Once installed, you can upload a spreadsheet such as the above into a spreadsheet table, which buttafly can then parse. Buttafly knows about your application's models, associations, and validations, and gives you an interface for mapping your spreadsheet columns to attributes in your application's models. For the spreadsheet example above, you would first create a mapping for wineries, then one for wines that belong to those wineries, then users, and then a final mapping for the review which can then be properly associated as belonging to both the user who wrote it and to the wine which is its subject. Once the mappings are created, you can then import the spreadsheet and it will use the mappings to create the correct associated winery, wine, user and review objects. </p>

<a id="getting-started" class="anchor" href="#getting-started" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting Started</h2>

<p>Add buttafly to your Gemfile with the following line:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-ruby"><pre><span class="pl-k">gem</span> <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>buttafly<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre></div>

<p>Then from the command line:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-console"><pre><span class="pl-mo">bundle install</span>
<span class="pl-mo">rake db:migrate</span></pre></div>

<p>Try it in development first by navigating to localhost:3000/buttafly.</p>

<p>After cloning the application, bundling its gems, and migrating the database, you can run your tests with guard from the root of the engine itself:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-console"><pre><span class="pl-mo">cd /buttafly</span>
<span class="pl-mo">bundle exec guard</span></pre></div>

<p>To see buttafly running from a dummy app, </p>

<div class="highlight highlight-console"><pre><span class="pl-mo">cd /buttafly/test/dummy</span>
<span class="pl-mo">bundle exec rails s</span></pre></div>
