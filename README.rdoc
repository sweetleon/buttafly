== Description

---
Buttafly is a Rails engine designed to help you get production quality data into your Rails application from spreadsheets. For example, if you have a wine review application where each review belongs to a wine, and each wine belongs to a winery, and need to create winery, wine, and review objects with the correct associations, it should do the trick.
