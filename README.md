git # Buttafly

## Description

Buttafly is a Rails engine designed to help you get production quality data into your Rails application from spreadsheets. For example, if you have a wine review application where each review belongs to a wine, and each wine belongs to a winery, and you need to create winery, wine, and review objects with the correct associations from each row, it should do the trick.

## Getting Started

Add buttafly to your Gemfile with the following line:

```ruby
gem 'buttafly'
```

Then from the command line:

```console
bundle install
```
